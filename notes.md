## RDDs
- RDD - Resilient Distributed Datasets
- RDD API (Application Programmers Interface) was released in 2011
- RDD is an immutable and resilient distributed collection of elements of your data that is partitioned across nodes in your cluster
- RDD operations are typically referred to as Transformations and Actions, and the operations are executed in parallel
- RDDs are fault-tollerent
- So why learn RDDs?
    - You want low level transformation and actions to control your datasets
    - You want to handle unstructured data that cannot be handled by structured API's such as Dataframe and Datasets
    - You want to optimize your spark applications using a low level API
- RDDs - manipulate raw Java objects, Datafames you manipulate Spark types
